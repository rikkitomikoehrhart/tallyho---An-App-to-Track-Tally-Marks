# **tallyho**

## An App to Track Tally Marks
---
**tallyho** is an iOS app that keeps track of tally marks. This is part of my final project for Programming Fundamnetals II: Apple Swift II.

- I used Canva to design the app icon and branding (A HUGE Thank You to [Jessica Lee-Wen of Fatbaby Marketing](https://www.fatbabymarketing.com) for helping and guiding me!)
- I used figma to design the app layout.
- I used Xcode to code and build the app.

This project has no dependcies other than Xcode.
